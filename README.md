#  Responsive Web Page

A simple, clean, and fully responsive web page created using **HTML5** and **CSS3**. This project demonstrates the use of semantic HTML structure, Flexbox, and media queries to ensure mobile-friendly behavior across devices.

##  Features

-  Semantic and accessible HTML structure
-  Fully responsive layout
-  Header with navigation links
-  Adaptive content section
-  Mobile-optimized with media queries

---

##  Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox & Media Queries)

##  Project Structure

responsive-page/ ├── index.html       # Main HTML page └── style.css        # Styles for layout and responsiveness

---

##  How It Works

- The header contains a site title and navigation bar.
- The main section includes a content block with a heading and paragraph.
- The CSS styles:
  - Apply Flexbox to layout header items
  - Use media queries to stack the header and nav links on smaller screens

---

##  Responsive Design

-  Desktop: Navigation is horizontal next to the title
-  Tablet & Mobile: Navigation links stack vertically
-  Uses `@media (max-width: 768px)` for responsiveness

##  How to Run

You can view the webpage in a browser:

1. Clone or download the project folder
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/responsive-page.git
cd responsive-page
start index.html

> No server or dependencies needed – it's just static HTML and CSS.
